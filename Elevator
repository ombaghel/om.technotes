Other day Elevator questions were hot topic in Elevator:

Case 1: No acceleration of elevator
FN = +W = +mg.

Case 2: going up & speeding up (acceleration a is positive (up))
FN =mg+ma, which is GREATER than the true weight.

Case 3: going up & slowing down (acceleration a is negative (down))
FN =mg - ma

Case 4: going down & slowing down (acceleration a is positive (up))
FN =mg+ma, 

Case 5: going down & speeding up (acceleration a is negative (down))
FN =mg - ma, which is LESS than the true weight

Case 6: freefall (a = -g)
