Designing QA and Calculating score in simplest way:

DEFINE:
   lets say you need to ask users a bunch of questions...lets say 32!
   
MEASURE:
   variance of answer lets take possibilites/scale: 
    1= Never or very rarely true, 
    2= Rarely true, 
    3= Sometimes true, 
    4= Often true, 
    5= Very 
   -1= did not select an answer
SCORE:
    this is where your most logic goes which questions weighs more than others,  
    use below example with lets say 4 diffrent outcomes
     outcome1. round(add question scores*weightage/total questions)
     outcome2. round(add question scores*weightage/total questions)
     outcome3. round(add question scores*weightage/total questions)
     outcome4. round(add question scores*weightage/total questions)
                    
                    
                    
                    
 Thats all, 
 done!
